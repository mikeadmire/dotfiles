# dotfiles: My dotfiles

This does not include my dot vim files. Those are managed
in a seperate repo.

## Installation

This relies on [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) and Rbenv, available in [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mikeadmire/dotfiles/master/install.sh -o - | sh

To use the global .gitignore file

    git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
